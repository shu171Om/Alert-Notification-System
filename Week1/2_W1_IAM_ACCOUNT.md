## IAM Account Creation

To create an IAM account from root account we will go to IAM console.

> Create User -> User Name -> User Permission

We have Created a IAM User with name `Alert_Notification_developer`.

For now we have provided full Administrator Access to this IAM account.

So IAM Account Creation is done.
